# Raffle

**Raffle is a smart contract which conducts a raffle and which is written on Solidity**

# Installation

Run this comman in your terminal to create a new folder called Raffle in your directory, and to move to the Raffle directory
```
git clone https://github.com/BigAlQ/Raffle.git  
cd Raffle  
```
Run the command below to install all the neccessary dependencies for the raffle contract
```
make install
```
# Usage 

```
make anvil
```

# Deploy

```
make deploy
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

make sure you change the account name in the deploy-sepolia command in the make file 
```
forge script script/DeployRaffle.s.sol:DeployRaffle --rpc-url $(SEPOLIA_RPC_URL) --account PUT_YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $(ETHERSCAN_API_KEY) -vvvv
```

(to find your accounts, type this in the CLI)
```
cast wallet list
```


```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

This will setup a ChainlinkVRF Subscription for you. If you already have one, update it in the `scripts/HelperConfig.s.sol` file. It will also automatically add your contract as a consumer.

3. Register a Chainlink Automation Upkeep

[You can follow the documentation if you get lost.](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts)

Go to [automation.chain.link](https://automation.chain.link/new) and register a new upkeep. Choose `Custom logic` as your trigger mechanism for automation. Your UI will look something like this once completed:

## Scripts

After deploying to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts.

```
source .env
```

Using cast deployed locally example:


create a .env file and add your own spepolia rpc url and private key and etherscan API key like this
```
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://YOUR_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY

```

```
cast send <RAFFLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "enterRaffle()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

or, to create a ChainlinkVRF Subscription:

```
make createSubscription ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`

# Formatting

To run code formatting:

```
forge fmt
```

Have nice day!
